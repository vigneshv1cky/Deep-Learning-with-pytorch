### 1. **Defining the Model and Loss Function**

- **Model Function:**  
  The model is defined as a simple linear function:

  ```python
  def model(t_u, w, b):
      return w * t_u + b
  ```

  Here, `t_u` is the input tensor (e.g., a temperature reading in an unknown scale), and `w` and `b` are the parameters (weight and bias). The model uses broadcasting, so even if `w` and `b` are scalars (zero-dimensional tensors), multiplying them with a vector works seamlessly.

- **Loss Function:**  
  The loss is computed using mean squared error (MSE):

  ```python
  def loss_fn(t_p, t_c):
      squared_diffs = (t_p - t_c)**2
      return squared_diffs.mean()
  ```

  This function calculates the difference between the model’s prediction `t_p` and the correct value `t_c`, squares those differences, and averages them to get a scalar loss.

---

### 2. **Manual Gradient Descent**

- **Numerical Estimation:**  
  Initially, the gradient (rate of change of loss with respect to parameters) is estimated using finite differences. For example, for parameter `w`:

  ```python
  delta = 0.1
  loss_rate_of_change_w = (
      loss_fn(model(t_u, w + delta, b), t_c) -
      loss_fn(model(t_u, w - delta, b), t_c)
  ) / (2.0 * delta)
  ```

  This approach probes how a small change in `w` affects the loss. The same is done for `b`.

- **Analytical Derivation:**  
  To improve on the crude numerical method, the text shows how to compute gradients analytically.  
  - For the loss function, using the fact that the derivative of \(x^2\) is \(2x\):

    ```python
    def dloss_fn(t_p, t_c):
        dsq_diffs = 2 * (t_p - t_c) / t_p.size(0)
        return dsq_diffs
    ```

  - For the model, the derivatives with respect to `w` and `b` are:

    ```python
    def dmodel_dw(t_u, w, b):
        return t_u

    def dmodel_db(t_u, w, b):
        return 1.0
    ```

  - These are combined using the chain rule into a gradient function:

    ```python
    def grad_fn(t_u, t_c, t_p, w, b):
        dloss_dtp = dloss_fn(t_p, t_c)
        dloss_dw = dloss_dtp * dmodel_dw(t_u, w, b)
        dloss_db = dloss_dtp * dmodel_db(t_u, w, b)
        return torch.stack([dloss_dw.sum(), dloss_db.sum()])
    ```

  This function computes the gradient vector for `[w, b]` by summing over all data points (which comes from the broadcasting operation in the forward pass).

- **Parameter Updates:**  
  With the gradients computed, the parameters are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient scaled by a small learning rate:

  ```python
  learning_rate = 1e-2
  w = w - learning_rate * loss_rate_of_change_w
  b = b - learning_rate * loss_rate_of_change_b
  ```

  This is the essence of gradient descent.

---

### 3. **Improving the Training Process**

- **Stability and Learning Rate:**  
  The text demonstrates that if the learning rate is too high, the parameter updates overshoot and the loss can “blow up” (diverge to infinity). Reducing the learning rate (e.g., to 1e-4) makes the training stable, though the loss then decreases slowly.

- **Normalizing Inputs:**  
  Another key insight is that the gradients for `w` and `b` might be on very different scales if the input values are large. By normalizing the input (e.g., multiplying `t_u` by 0.1), the gradients become more balanced:

  ```python
  t_un = 0.1 * t_u
  ```

  This rescaling helps in applying a single learning rate for both parameters effectively.

- **Iterative Training Loop:**  
  The full training loop iterates over many epochs (or passes through the data) to update the parameters gradually. It logs the loss periodically and shows that the parameters converge toward the values needed (in this case, approximating the conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius).

---

### 4. **PyTorch’s Autograd for Automatic Differentiation**

- **Enabling Gradient Tracking:**  
  Instead of computing gradients manually, PyTorch’s autograd system automatically records the operations on tensors that have `requires_grad=True`. For example:

  ```python
  params = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0], requires_grad=True)
  ```

  This tells PyTorch to track operations on `params` so that when you call:

  ```python
  loss.backward()
  ```

  the gradients with respect to `params` are computed and stored in `params.grad`.

- **Zeroing Gradients:**  
  A crucial step is to zero out gradients before each backward pass because gradients accumulate:

  ```python
  if params.grad is not None:
      params.grad.zero_()
  ```

  This prevents gradients from previous iterations from interfering with the current update.

- **Using the Autograd-Enabled Training Loop:**  
  The training loop is updated to use autograd. Instead of manually computing the gradient, you simply call `loss.backward()` and then update the parameters:

  ```python
  for epoch in range(1, n_epochs + 1):
      if params.grad is not None:
          params.grad.zero_()
      t_p = model(t_u, *params)
      loss = loss_fn(t_p, t_c)
      loss.backward()
      with torch.no_grad():
          params -= learning_rate * params.grad
      print('Epoch %d, Loss %f' % (epoch, float(loss)))
  ```

---

### 5. **Optimizers and Abstraction**

- **Using Optimizers:**  
  PyTorch provides an `optim` module that abstracts the update rule for you. For example, using stochastic gradient descent (SGD):

  ```python
  import torch.optim as optim
  optimizer = optim.SGD([params], lr=learning_rate)
  ```

  In the training loop, you then:
  - Zero the gradients with `optimizer.zero_grad()`
  - Call `loss.backward()`
  - Update parameters with `optimizer.step()`
  
  This approach encapsulates the update logic and makes it easy to switch between optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) by simply changing the optimizer instantiation.

---

### 6. **Validation, Overfitting, and Data Splitting**

- **Overfitting Explained:**  
  Overfitting happens when a model fits the training data too well (even capturing noise) and fails to generalize to new, unseen data. In the text, it is explained that if the training loss decreases but the validation loss (evaluated on data not seen during training) does not, the model is likely overfitting.

- **Splitting the Data:**  
  The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set. The code uses `torch.randperm` to randomly shuffle indices and then separate a portion of the data:

  ```python
  n_samples = t_u.shape[0]
  n_val = int(0.2 * n_samples)
  shuffled_indices = torch.randperm(n_samples)
  train_indices = shuffled_indices[:-n_val]
  val_indices = shuffled_indices[-n_val:]
  train_t_u = t_u[train_indices]
  train_t_c = t_c[train_indices]
  val_t_u = t_u[val_indices]
  val_t_c = t_c[val_indices]
  ```

- **Evaluating Validation Loss:**  
  During training, the model is evaluated on both the training set (for updating parameters) and the validation set (for monitoring overfitting). Notice that gradients are not computed for the validation set—often wrapped in a `torch.no_grad()` block—to save computation and prevent unintentional gradient updates.

---

### 7. **Disabling Autograd When Not Needed**

- **Efficiency During Inference:**  
  When evaluating the model on the validation set (or during inference), you don’t need to track operations for gradient computations. Using:

  ```python
  with torch.no_grad():
      val_t_p = model(val_t_u, *params)
      val_loss = loss_fn(val_t_p, val_t_c)
  ```

  This disables autograd temporarily, which saves memory and speeds up computation. It also ensures that the validation pass does not affect the gradient state of your parameters.

---
