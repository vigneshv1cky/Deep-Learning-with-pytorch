### 1. **From Linear Models to Neural Networks**

- **Linear Model Recap:**  
  Initially, you learned how a basic linear model (with one input and one output) can be trained using gradient descent. This model makes predictions by applying a simple linear transformation:  
  \[
  \text{output} = w \times x + b
  \]
  where \( w \) (weight) and \( b \) (bias) are learned parameters.

- **Moving to Neural Networks:**  
  While a linear model can only capture straight-line relationships, many real-world problems are nonlinear. Neural networks overcome this limitation by stacking layers of simple operations (neurons) that combine linear transformations with nonlinear activation functions. This allows them to approximate complex functions.

### 2. **Understanding Artificial Neurons**

- **What Is an Artificial Neuron?**  
  Each neuron performs a two-step process:  
  1. **Linear Transformation:** Multiply the input by a weight and add a bias (\( w \times x + b \)).
  2. **Activation Function:** Apply a nonlinear function (like \(\tanh\), sigmoid, or ReLU) to the result. This nonlinearity enables the network to learn more complex patterns.
  
- **Activation Functions:**  
  These functions determine how a neuron fires in response to inputs. For example, \(\tanh\) squashes the output between -1 and 1. Different activation functions (such as ReLU or sigmoid) have various properties that influence learning, like handling saturation (regions where the gradient is very small) or maintaining sensitivity to changes in input.

### 3. **Layering Neurons: Building a Network**

- **Multilayer Networks:**  
  A neural network is built by stacking layers of neurons. Each layer’s output becomes the next layer’s input. Even though each individual neuron is simple, their composition allows the network to model very complicated functions.

- **Hidden Layers:**  
  The layers between the input and output layers are called hidden layers. They capture intermediate representations of the input data. For example, the excerpt describes a network that first expands a 1-dimensional input to 13 hidden features, applies a \(\tanh\) activation, and then reduces it back to a 1-dimensional output.

### 4. **Implementing Neural Networks in PyTorch**

- **The `nn` Module:**  
  PyTorch’s `torch.nn` module provides a collection of classes (called modules) that simplify building and training neural networks. For instance:
  - **`nn.Linear`:** Implements a linear transformation. It automatically creates and tracks the weights and biases.
  - **`nn.Sequential`:** Allows you to chain layers together in a sequential (one-after-another) manner.

- **Forward Pass vs. **call** Method:**  
  In PyTorch, when you call a module (e.g., `model(x)`), it internally calls the `forward` method. This is important because additional processing (such as hooks) is handled in the `__call__` method, so you should always call the model directly rather than invoking `forward` yourself.

- **Batching:**  
  Neural network modules in PyTorch are designed to process batches of inputs at once. This means even if your data is one-dimensional, you need to reshape it (e.g., using `unsqueeze`) to include a batch dimension. This batching is key for efficient computation on modern hardware like GPUs.

- **Training Loop:**  
  The training loop remains conceptually the same:
  1. **Forward pass:** Compute the model’s predictions.
  2. **Loss computation:** Compare predictions to the true values using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error via `nn.MSELoss`).
  3. **Backward pass:** Compute gradients via backpropagation.
  4. **Parameter update:** Adjust the model parameters using an optimizer (like SGD).

### 5. **Inspecting and Updating Parameters**

- **Parameters:**  
  Each module (like a layer in the network) holds its own parameters (weights and biases). You can inspect these parameters (and their gradients) using methods like `model.parameters()` or `model.named_parameters()` for more descriptive output.
  
- **Example Network Structure:**  
  The example provided creates a small neural network using `nn.Sequential`:

  ```python
  seq_model = nn.Sequential(
      nn.Linear(1, 13),
      nn.Tanh(),
      nn.Linear(13, 1)
  )
  ```

  This network takes a 1-dimensional input, expands it to 13 features through a hidden layer with a non-linear activation, and then reduces it back to a 1-dimensional output.

### 6. **Why Use Neural Networks?**

Even though for the temperature conversion example a linear model might suffice, using neural networks introduces you to the techniques that allow for more flexibility and power when tackling complex, nonlinear problems. Neural networks are universal approximators—they can learn almost any function if provided enough data and capacity.

In summary, the excerpt guides you through the conceptual and practical steps of moving from a simple linear model to a neural network in PyTorch. It highlights how neural networks are constructed from simple building blocks (neurons), how activation functions introduce nonlinearity, and how PyTorch’s `nn` module simplifies the process of building, training, and inspecting these models.
